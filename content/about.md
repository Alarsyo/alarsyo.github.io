# About me:

I'm a CS student, quite passionate about programming, interested in
algorithms, parallel computing, distributed systems, sometimes machine
learning...

You can find [my resume here](https://resume.alarsyo.com/resume.pdf).

# About this site:

I'm using this site as a way to store lists, tips, and various
programming related things that I want to remember or access easily.

If someone finds something useful here, that's even better, but this
is not the primary purpose of this site.
