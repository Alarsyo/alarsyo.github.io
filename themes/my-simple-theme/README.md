# My Simple Theme

A simple Hugo theme, built for my usage (powers https://alarsyo.com).

The theme uses [Bulma](https://bulma.io) as its CSS framework.

## Getting started

Getting a your Hugo website running with this theme is extremely
simple:

* Add the theme to your `themes/` directory, and tell Hugo to use it
  in your `config.yaml`:
  
  ```yaml
  baseURL: "https://example.com"
  title: "My Awesome Website"
  
  theme: my-simple-theme
  ```
  
* In your `content/` folder, write a simple `_index.md` page with just
  a simple message inside; that message will greet visitors on your
  homepage.
  
* Also in your `content/` folder, write an `about.md` page to tell
  more about your site to the readers.
  
* You can then write posts in the `content/posts/` directory.
